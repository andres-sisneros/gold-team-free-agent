Also please note that the backend salaries from 2020-2022 are estimated and likely are a bit lower in 2020 and 2021 and higher in 2022. I will update when I confirm the actual numbers but for right now they are estimates. Per Graziano, Carr received a $12.5 million signing bonus and a $7.5 million roster bonus in 2017. His 2017 base salary and a $15 million 2018 roster bonus are also guaranteed to bring the full guarantee on the contract to $40 million. Carr\'s 2018 and 2019 base salaries are guaranteed for injury at signing and will become fully guaranteed at the start of the waiver period of the 2018 and 2019 years. Carr has another $2.8 million guarantee in 2020 which brings the total guarantee to $70.2 million.
